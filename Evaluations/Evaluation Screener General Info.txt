Evaluation Screener General Info

Screener Overview
Recognizing signs of mental health disorders is not always easy. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) 
is a diagnostic tool for mental health disorders used by health care professionals that is quick 
and easy for patients to complete. In the mid-1990s, Robert L. Spitzer, MD, Janet B.W. Williams, DSW, and Kurt Kroenke, MD,
 and colleagues at Columbia University developed the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD), 
 a diagnostic tool containing modules on 12 different mental health disorders. T
 hey worked in collaboration with researchers at the Regenstrief Institute at Indiana University and 
 with the support of an educational grant from Pfizer Inc. During the development of PRIME-MD, Drs. Spitzer, Williams and Kroenke, 
 created the PHQ and GAD-7 screeners.

The PHQ, a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD, contains the mood (PHQ-9), anxiety, alcohol, eating, 
and somatoform modules as covered in the original PRIME-MD. The GAD-7 was subsequently developed as a brief scale for anxiety. 
The PHQ-9, a tool specific to depression, simply scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria based on the mood module from the original PRIME-MD. 
The GAD-7 scores 7 common anxiety symptoms. Various versions of the PHQ scales are discussed in the Instruction Manual.

All PHQ, GAD-7 screeners and translations are downloadable from this website and no permission is required to reproduce, 
translate, display or distribute them.
