Your Stress index score ( 1pt for each yes )

 0 –  5: 	There are few hassles in your life. Make sure, though, that you are not trying
			so hard to avoid problems that you shy away from challenges.
 6 – 12: 	You’ve got your life in fairly good control. Work on the choices and habits that 
			could still be causing you some unnecessary stress in your life
13 – 17: 	You’re approaching the danger zone. You may well be suffering stress-related symptoms 
			and your relationships could be strained. Think carefully about your voices and take relaxation breaks each day
18 – 22: 	Emergency! You must stop now, re-think how you are living, change your attitudes, 
			and pay careful attention to diet, exercise, and relaxation.
